# VHH-3D-pipeline-prediction

This is pipeline is based upon the following research projects:


*   [NanoNet: Rapid and accurate end-to-end nanobody modeling by deep learning](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2022.958584/full)
*   [DLPacker: Deep learning for prediction of amino acid side chain conformations in proteins](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/prot.26311)

Superimposition can fail depends on predictions.
